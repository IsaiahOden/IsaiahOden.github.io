        <h1 id="summary-title">Weekly Learning Summary</h1>
        <p id="summary-intro">This week, I expanded my knowledge in various areas of web development. Below are some key concepts I focused on:</p>
        
        <section id="subject-1">
            <h2 class="subject-title">Syntax</h2>
            <p class="subject-text">Syntax was arguably the most important term and concept we discussed this week. It's essentially the
                structure of the code and how it's written. Syntax is crucial because it can make or break the functionality of a program.</p>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="subject-2">
            <h2 class="subject-title">Git Push</h2>
            <p class="subject-text">Now this was one of the terms that we probably had to use most often in our assignments this week.
                Git push is essentially the command that sends your committed changes to a remote repository. It's a crucial step in the version control process.</p>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="subject-3">
            <h2 class="subject-title">Version Control</h2>
            <p class="subject-text">A crucial concept that will persist throughout our entire career in technology, version control is usually controlled through GitHub.
                It's essentially a way to manage changes to code over time, and it's crucial for collaboration and tracking changes.</p>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="subject-4">
            <h2 class="subject-title">Domain</h2>
            <p class="subject-text">The same way we call each other by our given name rather than our Social Security Number, domains allow us
                to access websites by name rather than by IP address. It's a pivotal part of the internet and web development.</p>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="subject-5">
            <h2 class="subject-title">HTML</h2>
            <p class="subject-text">HTML stands for HyperTextMarkupLanguage and is the first language that we learn in Code School.
                It's the backbone of most websites on the internet and is used to structure content on the web. Understanding HTML is fundamental to web development.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="subject-6">
            <h2 class="subject-title">Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p class="subject-text">The Growth Mindset was the most powerful topic we covered last week in class. 
                It's the idea that our abilities and intelligence can be developed with time, effort, and dedication. This concept is crucial for success in any field.</p>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="subject-7">
            <h2 class="subject-title">Git Commit</h2>
            <p class="subject-text">Another one of the Git commands we used frequently this week was Git commit. This command is used to save changes to the local repository.
